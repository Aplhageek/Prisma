# Setting Up Prisma with TypeScript

## Initialize Project

1. **Initialize npm project:**
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

2. **Install Prisma, TypeScript, and related dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
    ```

3. **Initialize TypeScript configuration:**
    ```bash
    npx tsc --init
    ```

4. **Initialize Prisma:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma init
    ```
    -This creates the `prisma` directory with `schema.prisma` and `.env` files.
    -with default configuration for datasource and generator

5. **Update `.env` file:**
    Don't forget to update your database URL string in the `.env` file.

## Datasource

- Defines your database and its URL.
- By default, it is autogenerated, but you can change it to, e.g., MongoDB.
- You can have only one datasource and the URL is mandatory.

## Generator

- Defines which generator to use (default is `prisma-client-js`).
- You can use custom generators as mentioned in the docs.
- You can have multiple generators.
- It creates your own client library in `node_modules`.

## Migrations

Run the following command to create a migration file and synchronize all changes with the database:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```


## Running Migrations

To initiate a migration with an optional name (`init` in this example), use the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

- --name is optional this will migratation file and make all the changes Sync with
- DB migraiton will contain equivalent .sql file first it creates the migration
- then starts the generations

- ![Prisma client](image.png) generates a prisma client in nodemodules everytime
- you migrate the changes will me added to our own "Prisam Client"

- we need client lib for this
- 

## Installing Prisma Client

To gain access to the Prisma client in your project, run the following command: or to install our client

```bash
npx i @prisma/client
```


## Generating Prisma Client

To automatically generate the Prisma client and obtain starter code for using the client, run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

you can create a new client folder and use ts file to work with client you can
pass option to log querries by using

```nodejs
export const prismaClient = new PrismaClient({log : ["query"] });
```

you have these many options to log ==>> query, info, warn, error

## Working with Prisma

Since Prisma operations are asynchronous, ensure to handle errors with `try...catch` blocks or use async/await syntax.

### Define Script to Start

To set up a development script that monitors changes in the Prisma client folder using Nodemon, add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon client/prisma"
}
```

## Models

In Prisma, models represent tables in your database schema. Each model should at least include an `id` field.

### Field Structure

Every field in a model follows these conventions:

1. **Name of the Field**: Specifies the name of the field in the database table.
   
2. **Type of Field**: Describes the data type of the field. Supported types include:
   - `Int`
   - `Id`
   - `String`
   - `User`
   - Additional types such as `BigInt`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `DateTime`, and `JSON` (supported by a limited number of databases).

3. **Type Modifiers**: Indicates optional or required status:
   - `?` for optional fields
   - `!` for required fields

4. **Attributes**: Defines specific properties or behaviors of the field, such as:
   - `@default(autoincrement())`: Sets a default value (e.g., auto-incrementing for IDs).
   - `@unique`: Ensures the field's value is unique across all records.

### Extra Types

- **unsupported**: Used when migrating between different databases to list unsupported data types.
  
- **Bytes**: Used to represent byte information.
  
- **JSON**: Supported by only a few databases.
