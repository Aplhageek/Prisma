it defines with generator we use by default its prisma-client-js but we can use
custom diff generators mentioned in docs

you can have multiple generators

it creates our own client lib in nodemodules.

## npx prisma migrate dev --name init

--name is optional this will migratation file and make all the changes Sync with
DB migraiton will contain equivalent .sql file first it creates the migration
then starts the generations

![Prisma client](image.png) generates a prisma client in nodemodules everytime
you migrate the changes will me added to our own "Prisam Client"

we need client lib for this

## npx i @prisma/client

this will give us access to our client

## `npx prisma generate`

will auto generate cient for us and give a starter code for us to start using
client

you can create a new client folder and use ts file to work with client you can
pass option to log querries by using

```
export const prismaClient = new PrismaClient({log : ["query"] });
```

you have these many options to log ==>> query, info, warn, error

## Models
models tables
they should at least have id 
every row is a field
every field has 4 cols
1 --> name of field 
2 --> type of field ===>> like Int Id String User     "models can also be type" ===>> BigInt, FLoat, Boolean, DateTime, JSON(only supportedby few)
3 --> type modifiers===>> like ? = options ! = required
4 --> Attributes ==> defines the nature of the field ===>> eg, @default(autoincrement()), @unique, etc


types:
unsupported    --> for when we migrate from diff DB to different DB not all types are supported so this is used to list them
Bytes          --> for byte info
JSON           --> only supported by few
